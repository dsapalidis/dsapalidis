- 👋 Hi, I’m @dsapalidis
- 👀 I’m interested in optical and structural properties of nanomaterials (thin films, nanowires, nanoparticles).I am also interested in developing programming tools for the improvement of our capability for faster and easier data analysis for optical and X-ray characterization techniques. I am currently investigating quantum materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy exploring exotic phase transitions under high pressure and low temperature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about AI in Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational physics and materials science projects
- 📫 How to reach me: dsapalidis@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: my public repository "Atlantis" is quite useful, trust me
